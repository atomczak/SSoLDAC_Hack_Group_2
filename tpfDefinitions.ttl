Only a nominal amount of steel is placed near the exposed faces to prevent surface cracking due to temperature changes. A semi-gravity wall is somewhat more slender than a gravity wall and requires reinforcement consisting of vertical bars along the inner face and dowels continuing into the footing. It is provided with temperature steel near the exposed face. A cantilever wall consists of a concrete stem and a concrete base slab, both of which are relatively thin and fully reinforced to resist the moments and shears to which they are subjected. A counterfort wall consists of a thin concrete face slab, usually vertical, supported at intervals on the inner side by vertical slabs or counterforts that meet the face slab at right angles. Both the face slab and the counterforts are connected to a base slab, and the space above the base slab and between the counterforts is backfilled with soil. All the slabs are fully reinforced. A soil nail wall is an earth-retaining system containing passive reinforcing elements that are drilled and grouted sub-horizontally in the ground.";
