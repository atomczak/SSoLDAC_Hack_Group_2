The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.NOTE  See ISO 19148 Geographic information – Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.Kinematic perspectiveIn the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.Geometric perspectiveIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.State of the art in contemporary engineeringContemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane.\\n\\n\\nIn a second step the vertical profile (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients  together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.\\n\\n\\nIn the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.\\n\\n\\nIn a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.The sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements.Contemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach.The resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometryAccording to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each otherBusiness aspects of alignment\\nRepresentation with the IFC geometry resourcesBusiness aspects of alignment: Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency.Representation with IFC geometry resources: Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed.IFC modellingIn IFC a single alignment must have:a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate systemA single alignment may have:an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space\\na relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets\\na 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.Alignments may be aggregated into referents (IfcReferent) or derivative alignments.

This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype IfcElement) and spatial items (covered by the subtype IfcSpatialElement) the IfcProduct also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of IfcProduct, is handled by the IfcTypeProduct (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType. The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.NOTE  See IfcTypeProduct for how to use a common geometric representation and IfcRelDefinesByType for using and overriding common properties.On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:Having a control applied: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToControl linking the IfcProduct to an IfcControl\\nBeing assigned to a process: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess linking the IfcProduct to an IfcProcess\\nBeing assigned to a resource: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource linking the IfcProduct to an IfcResourceEXAMPLE  An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a construction task for construction planning.
